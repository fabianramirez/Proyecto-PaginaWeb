				<h2>BACK-END VS. FRONT-END</h2>
				<p>
					Throughout our career we have heard these terms, but I am sure that most have not paid due attention, that is why this first entry and especially before starting with everything else, we have to know the point difference between these two Concepts. Without being too technical, the front-end refers to the part that the browser displays the information, the same part that interacts with the users and receives the input data. For this use technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, the Back end being on the server side, interacts with the databases and, of course, makes the operations on the data obtained by the front-end. To do this it also uses technologies and some of them are PHP, Python and Java.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you can see, here are presented these concepts quite summarized, but we think it is a very good way to begin to have a global idea of them. With the passage of time, these concepts will be complemented with more information and we can even get to have our own definition.
